# alx_travel_app_0x01

## Overview
In this task, you will enhance the alx_travel_app project by implementing API views to manage listings and bookings. You’ll create fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints using Django REST Framework (DRF) and document them with Swagger for ease of access and testing. The focus is on following RESTful API design principles while ensuring endpoints are properly tested for reliability.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

- Implement ViewSets in Django REST Framework to handle multiple model operations efficiently.
- Configure API routes using DRF’s routers.
- Apply RESTful conventions in API endpoint design.
- Document APIs with Swagger for clear and interactive API exploration.
- Test API endpoints with tools like Postman to verify correctness.

## Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

- Create and manage CRUD endpoints for multiple models in Django REST Framework.
- Integrate automatic API documentation with Swagger.
- Deploy well-structured and tested API endpoints that follow REST best practices.
- Confidently test API functionalities for both successful and error scenarios.

## Key Concepts
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for API resources.
- ModelViewSet: A DRF class that provides a complete set of CRUD actions without extra boilerplate.
- Routers in DRF: Automatically map ViewSets to URLs in a RESTful format.
- Swagger API Documentation: Automatically generated interactive API docs.
- API Testing: Using tools like Postman to validate API functionality.

## Tools and Libraries
- Django – High-level Python web framework.
- Django REST Framework (DRF) – Toolkit for building Web APIs.
- drf-yasg or django-rest-swagger – For Swagger documentation generation.
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite) – Database for storing listings and bookings data.
- Postman – For testing API endpoints.

## Real-World Use Case
This task mirrors the backend development process for travel booking platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, or Expedia. These platforms need robust APIs to manage property listings and handle booking requests efficiently. By implementing CRUD endpoints and documenting them with Swagger, developers create scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-test backends that can serve mobile and web applications in real-time.



## Models

### Listing

*   `title`: `CharField`
*   `description`: `TextField`
*   `price`: `DecimalField`
*   `address`: `CharField`
*   `country`: `CharField`
*   `city`: `CharField`

### Booking

*   `listing`: `ForeignKey` to `Listing`
*   `guest`: `ForeignKey` to `User`
*   `check_in_date`: `DateField`
*   `check_out_date`: `DateField`
*   `num_guests`: `PositiveIntegerField`

### Review

*   `listing`: `ForeignKey` to `Listing`
*   `guest`: `ForeignKey` to `User`
*   `rating`: `PositiveIntegerField`
*   `comment`: `TextField`

## Serializers

### ListingSerializer

Serializes all fields of the `Listing` model.

### BookingSerializer
